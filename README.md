### You can always count on me when 
I am always trying to make others feel comfortable. 
I don't have a lot of skills in web dev so maybe you'll have to help more than I can help but I will always try to help you if I can, either by sharing my knowledge or by looking up solutions with you. 
I am always in a good mood and will always by nice to you if you come to me. 
Also I'm quite a good organizer so I could be the organizer if we do a team work. 
And last, if you would like some help in your oral presentations skills I can try to help you and give you some tips as I iused to do a lot of presentation during my studies.
### My funny story 
Tell a short funny story about your life.

#### TL;DR 
Summerise your funny story in one short sentence.

At the bottom of the page there should be a next and previous link, this should link to the page of the previous student (alphabetically) and the next one.
Organise yourself so it is easy to know who you should link to.

The links should have the following structure:

<< previous || YOUR NAME || next >>
