### You can always count on me when 
I am always trying to make others feel comfortable. 

I don't have a lot of skills in web dev so maybe you'll have to help me more than I can help but I will always try my best to help you if I can, either by sharing my knowledge or by looking up solutions with you. 

I am always in a good mood and will always by nice to you if you come to me.

Also I'm quite a good organizer so I could be the organizer if we do a team work. 

Finally, if you would like some help in your oral presentations skills I can try to help you and give you some tips as I used to do a lot of presentations during my studies.
### My funny story 
My funny story happened during a warm nigh of summer. I was invited by a friend at a barbecue with a lot of people I didn't know before. 

The host had quite a nice house with a big glass door leading to the garden and the barbecue.

It was a very warm day and I didn't eat a lot before going there. I drank a few glass of sangria and soon I could feel the effect of alcohol. 

It was getting late and therefore it was getting colder. So someone closed the glass door.

BUT when I wanted to go back inside to grab another glass of sangria I didn't see that the door was closed. So I just banged in the door in front of all those 20 people I didn't know.:v:
Best barbecue party! Also I decided to drink water for the rest of the night.

#### TL;DR 
I once banged myself against a glass door.
